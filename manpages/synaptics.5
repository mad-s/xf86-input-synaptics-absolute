The driver behavior can be configured with parameters. These
parameters are options in the InputDevice section in the XFree86
config file. See the INSTALL file for a working example. If you have
the SHMConfig parameter enabled, these parameters can also be changed
at runtime with the synclient program.

The LeftEdge, RightEdge, TopEdge and BottomEdge parameters are used to
define the edge and corner areas of the touchpad. The parameters split
the touchpad area in 9 pieces, like this:

        LeftEdge  RightEdge
            v         v
            |         |       Physical top edge
          1 |    2    | 3
        -------------------   TopEdge
            |         |
         4  |    5    | 6
            |         |
        -------------------   BottomEdge
         7  |    8    | 9
            |         |       Physical bottom edge
        ^                 ^
     Physical          Physical
     left edge        right edge

Coordinates to the left of LeftEdge are part of the left edge (areas
1, 4 and 7), coordinates to the left of LeftEdge and above TopEdge
(area 1) are part of the upper left corner, etc. A good way to find
appropriate edge parameters is to enable the SHMConfig option and run
"synclient -m 1" to see the x/y coordinates corresponding to different
positions on the touchpad.

A tap event happens when the finger is touched and released in a time
interval shorter than MaxTapTime, and the touch and release
coordinates are less than MaxTapMove units apart. A "touch" event
happens when the Z value goes above FingerHigh, and an "untouch" event
happens when the Z value goes below FingerLow.

The MaxDoubleTapTime parameter has the same function as the MaxTapTime
parameter, but for the second, third, etc tap in a tap sequence. If
you can't perform double clicks fast enough (for example, xmms depends
on fast double clicks), try reducing this parameter. If you can't get
word selection to work in xterm (ie button down, button up, button
down, move mouse), try increasing this parameter.

The ClickTime parameter controls the delay between the button down and
button up X events generated in response to a tap event. A too long
value can cause undesirable autorepeat in scroll bars and a too small
value means that visual feedback from the gui application you are
interacting with is harder to see.

The MinSpeed, MaxSpeed and AccelFactor parameters control the pointer
motion speed. The speed value defines the scaling between touchpad
coordinates and screen coordinates. When moving the finger very
slowly, the MinSpeed value is used, when moving very fast the MaxSpeed
value is used. When moving the finger at moderate speed, you get a
pointer motion speed somewhere between MinSpeed and MaxSpeed. If you
don't want any acceleration, set MinSpeed and MaxSpeed to the same
value.

The MinSpeed, MaxSpeed and AccelFactor parameters don't have any
effect on scrolling speed. Scrolling speed is determined solely from
the VertScrollDelta and HorizScrollDelta parameters. To disable
vertical or horizontal scrolling, set VertScrollDelta or
HorizScrollDelta to zero.

When hitting an egde, movement can be automatically continued.
If EdgeMotionUseAlways is false, edge motion is only used when
dragging. With EdgeMotionUseAlways set to true, it is also used for
normal cursor movements.

Edge motion speed is calculated by taking into account the amount of
pressure applied to the touchpad. The sensitivity can be adjusted
using the EdgeMotion parameters. If the pressure is below
EdgeMotionMinZ, EdgeMotionMinSpeed is used, and if the pressure is
greater than EdgeMotionMaxZ, EdgeMotionMaxSpeed is used. For a
pressure value between EdgeMotionMinZ and EdgeMotionMaxZ, the speed is
increased linearly.

Since most synaptics touchpad models don't have a button that
corresponds to the middle button on a mouse, the driver can emulate
middle mouse button events. If you press both the left and right mouse
buttons at almost the same time (no more than EmulateMidButtonTime
milliseconds apart) the driver generates a middle mouse button event.

Circular scrolling acts like a scrolling wheel on the trackpad.
Scrolling is engaged when a drag starts in the given CircScrollTrigger
region, which can be all edges, a particular side, or a particular
corner. Once scrolling is engaged, moving your finger in clockwise
circles around the trackpad will generate scroll down events and
counter clockwise scroll up events. Lifting your finger will disengage
circular scrolling. Use tight circles near the center of the pad for
fast scrolling and large circles for better control. When used
together with vertical scrolling, hitting the upper or lower right
corner will seamlessly switch over from vertical to circular
scrolling.

Coasting is enabled by setting the CoastingSpeed parameter to a
non-zero value. When coasting is enabled, horizontal/vertical
scrolling can continue after the finger is released from the
lower/right edge of the touchpad. The driver computes the scrolling
speed corresponding to the finger speed immediately before the finger
leaves the touchpad. If this scrolling speed is larger than the
CoastingSpeed parameter (measured in scroll events per second), the
scrolling will continue with the same speed in the same direction
until the finger touches the touchpad again.
